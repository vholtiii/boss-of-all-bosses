# üó°Ô∏è Combat System Guide - Boss of All Bosses

## Overview

The combat system in Boss of All Bosses is a sophisticated, multi-layered strategic system that simulates realistic mafia warfare. It combines tactical decision-making, resource management, and risk assessment to create engaging territorial battles.

## üéØ Core Combat Mechanics

### 1. **Combat Effectiveness Calculation**

The system calculates combat effectiveness using multiple factors:

```
Combat Effectiveness = (Soldiers √ó Training Multiplier √ó Equipment Bonus) + Modifiers
```

#### **Training Multiplier Formula:**
- **Base Multiplier:** 1.0
- **Level Bonus:** (Training Level - 1) √ó 0.2 (20% per level)
- **Experience Bonus:** (Experience / 100) √ó 0.5 (up to 50% from experience)

**Example:**
- Level 3 Training + 60% Experience = 1.0 + (2 √ó 0.2) + (0.6 √ó 0.5) = **1.9x multiplier**

#### **Equipment Effectiveness:**
- **Weapons:** Basic (+5%), Advanced (+15%), Military Grade (+30%)
- **Armor:** None (0%), Light (+8%), Heavy (+20%)
- **Vehicles:** None (0%), Cars (+10%), Armored (+25%)

### 2. **Victory Chance Calculation**

```
Victory Chance = (Attacker Effectiveness / Total Effectiveness) √ó 100
```

**Example Battle:**
- **Attacker:** 10 soldiers, Level 2 training, Advanced weapons = 10 √ó 1.4 √ó 1.15 = **16.1 effectiveness**
- **Defender:** 8 soldiers, Level 1 training, Basic weapons = 8 √ó 1.0 √ó 1.05 = **8.4 effectiveness**
- **Victory Chance:** 16.1 / (16.1 + 8.4) √ó 100 = **65.7%**
