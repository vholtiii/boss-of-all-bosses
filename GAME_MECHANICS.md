```

### Turn Structure

- **Lucchese Family**: Queens (Southwest quadrant)
- **Bonanno Family**: Staten Island (Northeast quadrant)
- **Colombo Family**: Manhattan (Center)

### Initial Unit Setup

- **1 Capo**: Can fly up to 5 hexagons away
- **1 Boss**: Stays at headquarters permanently

## üó∫Ô∏è Territory Control System

### Territory Types
- **üü¢ Player Controlled**: Your family's territory (green)
- **üî¥ Rival Controlled**: Other families' territory (red)
- **‚ö™ Neutral**: Unclaimed territory (gray)

### 3-Step Takeover Process

#### Step 1: Deploy Soldiers
- **Cost**: Uses your available soldier count
- **Target**: Any territory (neutral, rival, or your own)
- **Purpose**: Establish presence for future actions
- **Visual**: Small masked soldier icons appear on map

#### Step 2: Take Action
**Hit Rival Territories:**
- **Success Rate**: 80% if outnumbering, 20% if outnumbered
- **Casualties**: 20% on victory, 40% on defeat
- **Rewards**: Territory control + $5,000 + 10 respect

**Extort Neutral Territories:**
- **Success Rate**: 90% (much easier)
- **Casualties**: 10% on success, 20% on failure
- **Rewards**: Territory control + $3,000 + 5 respect

#### Step 3: Optimize Income
**Deploy Capo:**
- **Income**: 100% of territory's earning potential
- **Requirement**: Must be your controlled territory
- **Trade-off**: Replaces soldiers (can't use for other actions)

**Keep Soldiers:**
- **Income**: 30% of territory's earning potential
- **Benefit**: Soldiers remain available for other actions

### Strategic Territory Considerations
- **Neutral territories** are safer but less profitable
- **Rival territories** are riskier but more valuable
- **Capos maximize income** but limit flexibility
- **Soldiers provide income** while maintaining options
